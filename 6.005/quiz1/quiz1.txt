    .b B
    .c A B[X] D
    .d C [X] [X]
    .e B

    .a Type signature           Type of ADT operation           Java impl. strategy
        char, int -> Tetromino      creator                         public constructor
        void -> void                mutator                         instance method
        void -> char                observer                        instance method
    .b  A is stronger than B because its precondition is weaker (any char vs. any English
        alpha char)
[X]     B is incomparable to C because although B's precondition is weaker, C returns the
        same value for all inputs.

    .d Too specific?

4
    .a input shapes = 1, >1, all legal tetromino shapes
    .b No, because X is not a tetromino shape letter.
[X] .c Yes
    .d Yes

5
    .a  3 - Map of Tetromino locations is public, make it private
        8 - Returns mutable Tetromino from map - defensively copy this tetromino to avoid
        client mutation
