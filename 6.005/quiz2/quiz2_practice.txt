    .a  thread 1
            east.join(alyssa);
            east.migrate(west, alyssa);
        thread 2
            west.join(ben);
            west.migrate(east, ben);

    .b  Deadlock could occur if timeslicing occurs between the two threads such that
        thread 1 begins to migrate alyssa by acquiring the lock on itself, then thread 2
        attempts to migrate ben by acquiring the lock on itself. At this point, neither
        thread can call the other thread's join method, as each is waiting for the other
        to release its lock.
