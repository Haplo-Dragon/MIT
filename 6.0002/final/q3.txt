================

1
    .1 F
    .2 T
    .3 T
    .4 T
[X] .5 T
2
    assert comp(s) == (2 * len(s)) - (len(s))**2
3 [X]
    .1 E - none of the above
    .2 B - about equal
    .3 B - pi
4
    objective function      = G
    confidence interval     = H
    depth first search      = F
    hierarchical clustering = D
    greedy algorithm        = C
    feature vector          = I
5 
    B - sample bias
6
    .1
        class LIFO(JobQueue):
            def depart(self):
                try:
                    return self.jobs.pop(-1)
                except:
                    print("depart called with an empty queue")
                    raise ValueError("EmptyQueue")

        I would also need to change the call to test so that it examined buses with small
        capacities.
[X] .2 
        No, because LIFO and FIFO for small capacities would not be statistically
        significantly different.

    1 passenger
8
    Return totPassengers / leftWaiting
9 [X]
    Top     - A
    Middle  - D
    Bottom  - B
