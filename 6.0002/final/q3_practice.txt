    polymorphism        =   A - subclassing
    standard deviation  =   C - confidence interval
    clustering          =   D - linkage
    dynamic programming =   B - overlapping sub-problems
    merge sort          =   G - O(n log n)
5
    No, because shortestPath may not have considered paths which contain more nodes
    but less overall weight.
6
    Yes, it would change the path returned by minWeightPath, as the edge's weight would
    now be -1 instead of 1.

    def cheapestTrip(city1, city2, G):
        trip_out = minWeightPath(G, city1, city2)
        trip_home = minWeightPath(G, city2, city1)

        cheapest_trip = None

        if trip_out and trip_home:
            cheapest_trip = trip_out.getWeight() + trip_home.getWeight()

        return cheapest_trip
8
    This parameter allows the user to pass a maximum number of nodes they want to visit.
    If the max number of nodes is exceeded, minWeightPath2 returns None.
